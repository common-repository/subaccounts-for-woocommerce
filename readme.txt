A full suite of tools to create and manage sub-accounts in WooCommerce.

== Description ==

Subaccounts for WooCommerce allows the creation of subaccounts for your WooCommerce customers and subscribers.

Two modes are available:

* **Sub-User mode:** multiple separate accounts grouped together under one parent account (e.g. Holding Company).
* **Multi-User mode:** multiple users have access to a same master account (useful in case of Corporate Accounts).

The ability to create multiple subaccounts tied to a main parent account is extremely useful in all of the following usage scenarios:

* companies that need to add and manage accounts for their employees
* stores that need to place orders from different branches
* businesses with multiple decision-makers for purchases
* when parent accounts need to supervise and monitor all the activities made by their own sub-accounts (purchases, expenses, quotes, etc.) and even place orders on behalf of them;
* in the case of company accounts that need to place orders from different purchasing departments or through multiple purchasing managers (B2B and similar);
* in those situations where a sales agent or sales representative needs to create new accounts for newly acquired customers and, if desired, place orders on their behalf.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is a subaccount? =

A subaccount (or sub-account) is a secondary account that sits under a main parent account.

= What is a Manager? =

A **Manager** is a parent account.

= How many subaccounts can be created for each customer/subscriber? =

Subaccounts for WooCommerce (free version) gives you the possibility to create up to 10 subaccounts for each Manager (parent account). 

With *Subaccounts Pro* (premium version) each Manager can have an unlimited number of subaccounts.

= Can a parent account (Manager) place an order? =

Both parent accounts and subaccounts can place orders. Parent accounts can also place orders on behalf of subaccounts, while a subaccount can place orders only for itself.

= Is it possible to create multiple nested subaccounts (e.g. a subaccount of another subaccount)? =

Only the creation of two account levels is allowed: a main parent account (so called Manager) and one or more subaccounts tied to the parent account.

With **Supervisor Add-On** it is possible to set a parent account (Supervisor) above a Manager account type, thus allowing you (as an administrator) to create a three-level structure of nested accounts.

= Is it possible for an Administrator to create and set a subaccount for a customer from the WordPress backend (admin dashboard)? =

This option, along with many others, is only available in *Subaccounts Pro*, the premium version of the plugin.

= Is it possible to switch from Sub-User to Multi-User mode and vice versa after some orders have already been placed? =

We have done our best to ensure the highest level of compatibility between the two modes. Despite this, switching from one mode to the other after some orders have already been placed may result in some data being inaccurate.

For this reason we strongly recommend that you choose the mode that best suits your needs and stick with it.

= Does the plugin work on multisite installations? =

WordPress Multisite installations are not officially supported for now.
